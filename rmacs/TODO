mutability marks and checks during edits, motion

a global mark and point per buffer, updated when window-specific mark
and point are updated, used to initialise window mark and point when a
buffer is shown in a window

maybe make the `unhandled-command` code in `invoke` send an event
rather than hardcoded aborting

Plan:
 - visit-file command
 - list-buffers command

xsel for synchronising the clipboard?

Figure out some sensible way to implement search-backward-regexp.
 - retrying, with exponential doubling of distance from start point?

Modeset signature-set consistency checking. Modes in a modeset must
not have conflicting command signatures - signatures with the same
selector that are not eq?. Because mode command tables are mutable,
perhaps this is best done when a modeset is applied to a buffer?

`rope-empty?` is too complicated. Ensure that degenerate empty ropes
are never constructed, instead; this will allow simplification of
`rope-empty?` and will ensure all empty ropes are eq? to each other.
